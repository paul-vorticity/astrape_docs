Our work builds upon decades of geophysics research in both industry and academia. Our production-ready commercial solutions are designed for scalability, efficiency, and performance.

There are many tools and resources available to the public that can be great for learning about geophysics and understanding what makes a good inversion. Here are a few that we recommend and have found useful:
