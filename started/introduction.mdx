## Astrape Usage

Astrape’s software can be accessed:
- In your preferred cloud environment
- On your hardware
- Through Vorticity’s cloud based service

We offer a variety of ways to access our technology depending on the different needs and requirements of our clients and the geoscience community. Academic licenses for students and researchers are available as well.

## Vorticity Inversion Service

In addition to Astrape software, we also offer a full inversion service. Vorticity’s inversion service is useful for clients that may not have an in-house geophysicist to run the inversion process. 
For the inversion service, you provide the raw data, and we combine our world-class inversion engine with our expert geophysicists to provide you with the most accurate and detailed inversion results possible. 
Some of our clients prefer this process because it allows them to spend more time interpreting the results and less time worrying about the inversion process.

Traditional inversion techniques are constrained by limited computational power, often fail to fully leverage the survey data, and provide only a rough approximation of conductive areas while typically generating numerous artifacts. 
These limitations can lead to increased drilling and exploration costs. With Astrape, we can extract comprehensive information from the entirety of your survey data at a fraction of the cost of exploration drilling programs. 
The inversion model can then be integrated seamlessly into any geophysics exploration software.
