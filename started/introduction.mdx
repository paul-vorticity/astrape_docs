## How you can get access

All of our software can be accessed under a number of different subscription types each structured for the different needs and requirements of our clientâ€™s and the geoscience community.

We are able to setup the software on your own hardware, or provide you with access to our cloud based service. We also offer academic licenses for students and researchers.

 Please [contact us](mailto:astrape@vorticity.xyz) for more information.

## Inversion Service

We also offer a full inversion service where we will take your data and combine our world-class inversion engine with our expert geophysicists to provide you with the most accurate and detailed inversion results possible. Allowing you to spend more time interpreting the results and less time worrying about the inversion process.

Have you recently completed, or are you considering an AEM survey? Traditional inversion techniques, constrained by limited computational power, often fail to fully leverage the survey data, providing only a rough approximation of conductive areas and typically generating numerous artifacts. 
These limitations can lead to increased drilling and exploration costs. With Astrape, we can extract comprehensive information from the entirety of your survey data at a fraction of the cost of exploration drilling programs. 
The inversion model can then be integrated seamlessly into any geophysics exploration software.
