Being able to run fast simulations and inversions provides geophysicists with the tools to do new geopysics:

- High Resolution 
- MultiDimensional 
- Uncertainty Quantification 

So what makes us so much faster? Thats a great question, and the answer is a combination of the following factors:

- Leveraging Modern Computer Capabilities
- Smart Mathematics
- Artificial Intelligence
