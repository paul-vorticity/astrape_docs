title: 'Survey Configuration'
---

Here's a breakdown of the two approaches for defining upon which area of the survey you would like to run the inversion:

- Survey Area: Specify the southwest and northeast corner coordinates to define the rectangular area for your survey.
- Quadrilateral: Define the survey area using four points to create a quadrilateral shape.
- Individual Lines: Define each survey line using a unique identifier and its starting and ending coordinates.

When defining your survey, you can choose to specify either the individual survey lines you want to run or the area you want to invert (survey area or quadrilateral).
However, you can only provide one of these three options, not both.

<Tip> A survey configuration file is generated automatically during the preprocessing step. The default configuration will cover the entire survey area provided in the data file. However, you can modify it to adjust what area of the survey you would like to invert.</Tip>

  <Tab title="Survey Area">
    
  <AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="Southwest Corner (south_west)">
     The southwest corner coordinates define the bottom-left corner of the survey area. It should be provided as a list containing two integers representing the X and Y coordinates, respectively.
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion  title="Northeast Corner (north_east)">
     The northeast corner coordinates define the top-right corner of the survey area. It should be provided as a list containing two integers representing the X and Y coordinates, respectively.

     **Validation:** The southwest corner coordinates (X and Y) must be less than the northeast corner coordinates (X and Y) to ensure a valid survey area.

    Example: 
    ```
    area: 
      south_west: 
        - 708000
        - 5514500
      north_east:
        - 708500
        - 5515000
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quadrilateral">
    For defining a quadrilateral survey area, you'll need a dictionary within the configuration file. The keys in the dictionary should be named 'one', 'two', 'three', and 'four', and the values are lists containing the X and Y coordinates of the corners of the quadrilateral.

    Example: 
    ```
    quadrilateral:
      one:
        - 708000
        - 5514500
      two:
        - 708500
        - 5514500
      three:
        - 708500
        - 5515000
      four:
        - 708000
        - 5515000
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Individual Lines">
    For defining individual survey lines, you'll need a dictionary within the configuration file. The keys in the dictionary represent unique identifiers for each line (e.g., "L1", "L2"), and the values are lists containing the starting and ending distance along the line.

    Example: 
    ```
    lines:
      L1: 
        - 100
        - 400
      L2:
        - 300
        - 700
    ```
    "L1" is defined and the inversion will be performed on this line from 100m to 400m along the line.
    "L2" is defined and the inversion will be performed on this line from 330m to 700m along the line.
