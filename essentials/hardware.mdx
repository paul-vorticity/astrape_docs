Recent developments in GPU technology have made it possible to perform complex computations at a fraction of the time it would take on a CPU. Leveraging these advancements requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware architecture as well as restructuring and rethinking the problem we are trying to solve.

We have written our code from the ground up, allowing us to deliver high-resolution inversions in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional methods. 

## How to get access to GPUs 

Our software can be run on your own hardware, or we can get you setup on any of the major cloud providers. We can also provide you with access to our own hardware, which is optimized for running our software.
