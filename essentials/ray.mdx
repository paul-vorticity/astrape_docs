We have developed our algorithms using the [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html) library. A framework to build and scale Python applications easily.

It is particularly well-suited for applications that require high performance on large clusters, allowing us to scale our software to handle large and complex inversions. Before running an inversion with Astrape you must start a Ray cluster. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
ray start --head
```

Once a Ray cluster has been started the Ray dashboard can be accessed by connected to the correct IP address and port.
This dashboard provides a real-time view of the cluster's status and resource usage, as well as a log output from the inversion process, allowing you to monitor the inversion as it progresses.
