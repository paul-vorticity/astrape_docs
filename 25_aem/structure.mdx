### Super Folder: SurveyProject

In order to efficiently manage and process your survey data using our 2.5D inversion code, it's essential to organize your data into a well-structured folder hierarchy. The recommended structure ensures that all inputs, intermediate results, and final outputs are systematically stored. Below is an overview of the required folder structure.

#### Folder Structure

```
SurveyProject/
├── data/
├── inversion/
├── deliverables/
```

#### Description of Subfolders

- **data/**: This folder contains all the input files necessary for the inversion process. 
- **inversion/**: This folder holds all the intermediate data generated during the inversion process.
- **deliverables/**: This folder stores all the final outputs generated by the inversion process.

By organizing your files in this structure, you can ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, making it easier to manage your survey data and inversion results.
