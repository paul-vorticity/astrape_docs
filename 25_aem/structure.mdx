In order to efficiently manage and process your survey data using our 2.5D inversion code, it's essential to organize your input data into the well-structured folder hierarchy. The structure ensures that all inputs, intermediate results, and final outputs are systematically stored. 

Below is an overview of the folder structure which the astrape code supports:

#### Folder Structure

```
SurveyProject/
├── data/
├── inversion/
├── deliverables/
```

#### Description of Subfolders

- **data/**: This folder contains all the input files necessary for the inversion process. Please see [here](/25_aem/data_subfolder) for more details.  
- **inversion/**: This folder holds all the intermediate data generated during the inversion process. Each inversion run which you create will generate a new timestamped subfolder. 
- **deliverables/**: This folder stores all the final outputs generated by the inversion process. The subfolders here matches the timestamp name created in the inversion folder.

By organizing your files in this structure, you can ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, making it easier to manage your survey data and inversion results.
