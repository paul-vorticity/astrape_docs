<Steps>
  <Step title="Start ray">
    The first step is to setup a ray head node. This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    ray start --head
    ```
    If you would like to attach any other nodes to this cluster you can run the following command on that server: 
    ```
     ray start --address='172.17.9.10:6379'
    ```
    <Warning>You must replace the IP address with the one displayed from the output of the ray sart --head command.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Data Folder">
    The second step is to create a folder in which our inversion will be performed. Please see the survey folder structure [page](/25_aem/structure) for more details. 
    This folder must contain a subfolder named data which contains all the inputs for our inversion workflow. 
    Please see the data subfolder [page](/25_aem/data_subfolder) for more details. 
    <Tip>Ensure all necessary files are correctly placed in the `data` subfolder to avoid issues during the inversion process.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare System Configuration File">
    After setting up our inversion folder, the next step is to prepare the system configuration file. 
    This file defines how we read the data and the specifications of the airborne EM system. 
    Refer to the system configuration [page](/25_aem/configuration/system) for more details. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preprocessing ">
    In order to ensure we have setup our configuration file correctly and that the data is ready for the inverison we will run the preprocessing script.

    This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    astrape_25d preprocess /home/path_to_survey_folder
    ```

    <Info>
    Please ensure to replace the 'path_to_survey_folder' with the correct path. 
    </Info>
    <Warning>Running the preprocessing script with incorrect paths or data can lead to errors. Verify your paths and data files before running the script.</Warning>

    During the preprocessing step, the code will generate the discretization configuration file based on the provided data. It will also generate a line report and a discretization report to help you verify the data and discretization parameters.

    <Check>During the preprocessing step, the code will generate a csv file called data_modified.csv. This file will contain the data that will be used for the inversion in order to ensure the original data is not modified.</Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Survey + Inversion Configuration Files">
    After preprocessing the data, prepare the configuration files that define the survey area you are interested in inverting and the parameters for this inversion. 
    Refer to the survey configuration [page](/25_aem/configuration/survey) and the inversion configuration [page](/25_aem/configuration/inversion) for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Inversion">
    Now we are ready to run the inversion! 

    This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    astrape_25d run /home/path_to_survey_folder
    ```
    <Info>
    Once again, please ensure to replace the path to your inversion folder with the correct path. 
    </Info>

    <Warning>Depending on the number of survey lines, inversion parameters, and your hardware, the inversion process can take a significant amount of time. Please see our benchmarks for more details.</Warning> 
  </Step>
    <Step title="Postprocessing">
    After the inversion has been completed, you can perform postprocessing to analyze the results.

    This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    astrape_25d postprocess /home/path_to_survey_folder name_of_run_subfolder
    ```
    <Info>
    Once again, please ensure to replace the path to your inversion folder with the correct path and the name of the timestamped run subfolder.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Outputs">
    Once the inversion has been completed, you can view the outputs in the `deliverables` folder. 
    This folder contains all the final results, including reports and visualizations.
    <Check>Check the `deliverables` folder for the comprehensive [PDF report](/25_aem/outputs/report), the [data files](/25_aem/outputs/data) , and [visualizations](/25_aem/outputs/visualization) to analyze your inversion results.</Check>
