<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Data Folder">
    The first step is to create a folder in which our inversion will be performed. This folder must contain a subfolder named 'data' which contains all the inputs for our inversion workflow.
    The files necessary files within the data subfolder are the following:
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare System Configuration File">
    After having prepared our inversion folder, we will then prepare the system configuration file defines how we read the data, and the specifcations of the airborne EM system. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform Preprocessing ">
    In order to ensure we have setup our configuration file correctly and that the data is ready for the inverison we will run the preprocessing script.

    This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    python3 astrape/utils/preprocess.py -d /home/path_to_your_inversion_folder
    ```

    <Info>
    Please ensure to replace the path to your inversion folder with the correct path. 
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Survey + Inversion Configuration Files">
    After preprocessing the data we then must prepare the configuration files which define the area of the survey you are interested in inverting, and the parameters for this inversion. 

    Please see the configuration file pages for more details. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Inversion">
    Now we are ready to run the inversion! 

    This can be done with the following command: 
    ```
    python3 astrape/ray/survey_run.py -d /home/path_to_your_inversion_folder
    ```
    <Info>
    Once again, please ensure to replace the path to your inversion folder with the correct path. 
    </Info>

    Depending upon the number of lines km, the inversion parameters and the hardware you are running on, this inverison can take a while. 
    Please see our benchmarks for more details. 

  </Step>
  <Step title="View Outputs">
    Once the inversion has been completed we can take a look at the outputs from out inversion! This can be done in the "Deliverables" folder. 
  </Step>
