<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Data Folder">
    The first step is to create a folder in which our inversion will be performed. This folder must contain a subfolder named `data` which contains all the inputs for our inversion workflow. 
    The necessary files within the `data` subfolder are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Data File (CSV format)</li>
      <li>Offtime Sampling File (CSV format)</li>
      <li>Waveform File (CSV format)</li>
      <li><a href="/25_aem/configuration/system" tooltip="Details on system configuration">System Configuration File</a></li>
      <li><a href="/25_aem/configuration/survey" tooltip="Details on survey configuration">Survey Configuration File</a></li>
      <li><a href="/25_aem/configuration/inversion" tooltip="Details on inversion configuration">Inversion Configuration File</a></li>
      <li>Optional: Logo Image (e.g., company_logo.png)</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare System Configuration File">
    After setting up our inversion folder, the next step is to prepare the system configuration file. This file defines how we read the data and the specifications of the airborne EM system. Refer to the <a href="/25_aem/configuration/system" tooltip="System Configuration Documentation">System Configuration Documentation</a> for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform Preprocessing">
    To ensure that we have set up our configuration file correctly and that the data is ready for the inversion, we need to run the preprocessing script.
    <Callout type="info" title="Command to Run Preprocessing">
      Use the following command:
      ```bash
      python3 astrape/utils/preprocess.py -d /home/path_to_your_inversion_folder
      ```
      <Info>
        Replace `/home/path_to_your_inversion_folder` with the correct path to your inversion folder.
      </Info>
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Survey and Inversion Configuration Files">
    After preprocessing the data, prepare the configuration files that define the survey area you are interested in inverting and the parameters for this inversion. 
    Refer to the <a href="/25_aem/configuration/survey" tooltip="Survey Configuration Documentation">Survey Configuration Documentation</a> and <a href="/25_aem/configuration/inversion" tooltip="Inversion Configuration Documentation">Inversion Configuration Documentation</a> for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Inversion">
    Now we are ready to run the inversion! 

    <Callout type="info" title="Command to Run Inversion">
      Use the following command:
      ```bash
      python3 astrape/ray/survey_run.py -d /home/path_to_your_inversion_folder
      ```
      <Info>
        Replace `/home/path_to_your_inversion_folder` with the correct path to your inversion folder.
      </Info>
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning" title="Inversion Duration">
      Depending on the number of lines, inversion parameters, and the hardware you are running on, this inversion can take a while. Please refer to our <a href="/25_aem/benchmarks" tooltip="Benchmarking Information">benchmarks</a> for more details.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Outputs">
    Once the inversion has been completed, you can view the outputs in the `deliverables` folder. This folder contains all the final results, including reports and visualizations.
