The 3D visualization output provides an interactive view of the inverted model, allowing for detailed inspection of the inversion results. The key components of the 3D visualization include:

- **HTML Isosurface Plots**: Interactive HTML files showing isosurfaces of the conductivity values.
  - The isosurfaces are generated at different conductivity levels and provide a 3D representation of the subsurface conductivity distribution.
  - Each HTML file corresponds to a different isovalue and can be viewed in a web browser.

- **Shengbar GIF**: An animated GIF showing the Shengbar plots over the survey area.
  - The GIF provides a visual representation of the survey lines and the evolution of the conductivity values along these lines.

The 3D visualization files are saved in the `deliverables` directory within the survey region folder.
