### Key Visualization Outputs

- **HTML Isosurface Plots**: Interactive HTML files displaying isosurfaces of the conductivity values.
  - These isosurfaces, generated at varying conductivity levels, offer a 3D representation of the subsurface conductivity distribution.
  - Each HTML file corresponds to a specific isovalue and can be viewed by simply opening it in a web browser.
  <Warning>
  The isosurface plots are intended for an initial overview of all the lines inverted together in one run. They are not a substitute for a detailed analysis.
  For a comprehensive analysis, import the data into a geophysical interpretation software and perform a full kriging interpolation. Refer to the [data outputs](/25_aem/outputs/data) for more details.
  </Warning>

- **Inversion Iteration GIFs**: Animated GIFs showcasing the evolution of conductivity values throughout the inversion process.
  - Located in the "iteration_gifs" folder, these GIFs depict the model evolution for each line that was inverted in the run.
