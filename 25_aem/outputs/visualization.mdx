title: 'Visualization'
description: 'The visualization outputs provide a comprehensive view of the inversion results, allowing you to analyze the subsurface conductivity distribution and the evolution of the model over the iterations.'
---

The key visualization outputs include:

- **HTML Isosurface Plots**: Interactive HTML files showing isosurfaces of the conductivity values.
  - The isosurfaces are generated at different conductivity levels and provide a 3D representation of the subsurface conductivity distribution.
  - Each HTML file corresponds to a different isovalue and can be viewed by simply openning the file in a web browser.
  <Warning>
  The isosuface plots and inteded to be used as a first look at all the lines that were inverted together in one run, but they are not a substitute for a detailed analysis.
  For a more detailed analysis, please import the data into a geophysical interpretation software and perform a full kriging interpolation. Please see the [data outputs](/25_aem/outputs/data) for more details.
  </Warning>

- **Inversion Iteration GIFs**: An animated GIF showing the evolution of the conductivity values over the iterations of the inversion process.
  - Inside the "iteration_gifs" folder, you will find GIFs showing the model evolution for each line which was inverted as part of that run.
