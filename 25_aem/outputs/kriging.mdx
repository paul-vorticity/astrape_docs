  During postprocessing, a file called `astrape_extended_data.xyz` is generated. We can use this file to convert the 2.5D data to a 3D model using kriging in Oasis Montaj.
  
  This file can be easily opened and viewed within the Oasis Montaj software by importing it into a Geosoft database file (GDB). Please see [this guide](https://help.seequent.com/Oasismontaj/2023.2/Content/gxhelp/i/import_gx.htm) for instructions on how to import the data.

  Once the inversion model has been imported as a GDB file in Oasis Montaj, you can convert the 2.5D data to a 3D model by performing a [3D Kriging](https://help.seequent.com/Oasismontaj/2023.1/Content/gxhelp/v/geosoft_gx_voxutils_voxelkriging.htm). The kriging functionality in Oasis Montaj can be found under the `Voxel` tab:

  The choice of kriging parameters can have a significant impact on the 3D model. It is recommended to consult with a geophysicist or geostatistician to determine the best parameters for your specific dataset. We recommend performing the kriging on the "Log10_Conductivity_mSm" column.

  Ensure that the blanking distance is large enough to cover the distance between the survey lines. For example, if your survey lines are 100m apart and you are performing kriging using a cell size of 10m, ensure the blanking distance is >= 10m.

  The strike, dip, and plunge parameters of the kriging should be selected based on the geological context of the survey area. It is common to set the strike angle to be perpendicular to the survey lines and the strike weight to be 2.0. This will ensure that the kriging is biased in the direction perpendicular to the survey lines.

  <Warning>
    The kriging process can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. Increasing the cell size and reducing the blanking distance can help speed up the process, but may result in a loss of resolution.
  </Warning> 

  Make sure to consult the Oasis Montaj [3D Kriging](https://help.seequent.com/Oasismontaj/2023.1/Content/gxhelp/v/geosoft_gx_voxutils_voxelkriging.htm) documentation for more information on the kriging parameters and how to interpret the results.
