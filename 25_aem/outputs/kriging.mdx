    During post-processing, a file called `astrape_extended_data.xyz` is generated. This file can be used to convert 2.5D data into a 3D model using kriging in Oasis Montaj. To open and view this file, you need to import it into a Geosoft database file (GDB). Please refer to [this guide](https://help.seequent.com/Oasismontaj/2023.2/Content/gxhelp/i/import_gx.htm) for detailed instructions on importing the data.

    Once the inversion model has been imported, you can convert the 2.5D data to a 3D model by performing [3D Kriging](https://help.seequent.com/Oasismontaj/2023.1/Content/gxhelp/v/geosoft_gx_voxutils_voxelkriging.htm). The kriging functionality is located under the `Voxel` tab:

    Choosing the appropriate kriging parameters is crucial for the accuracy of the 3D model. It is recommended to consult with a geophysicist or geostatistician to determine the best parameters for your specific dataset. We suggest performing kriging on the "Log10_Conductivity_mSm" column.

    Ensure that the blanking distance is large enough to cover the distance between the survey lines. For example, if your survey lines are 100m apart and you are performing kriging with a cell size of 10m, make sure the blanking distance is at least 10m.

    The strike, dip, and plunge parameters for the kriging should be selected based on the geological context of the survey area. Typically, the strike angle is set perpendicular to the survey lines with a strike weight of 2.0 to ensure the kriging is biased in the direction perpendicular to the survey lines.

    <Warning>
    The kriging process can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. Increasing the cell size and reducing the blanking distance can speed up the process, but this may result in a loss of resolution.
    </Warning>
