The data output from the inversion process includes several files containing the processed data and results. The key files generated are:

- **astrape_inversion_data.csv**: Contains the x, y, z coordinates, line names, and conductivity values for each point in the survey.
  - Columns:
    - `x`: x coordinate in meters.
    - `y`: y coordinate in meters.
    - `z`: z coordinate in meters.
    - `Line`: Line name.
    - `Conductivity`: Conductivity value in S/m.

- **astrape_inversion_extended_data.csv**: Extends the data with additional columns for different measurements.
  - Columns:
    - `x`, `y`, `z`, `Line`, `Conductivity` (same as above).
    - `Conductivity_mSm`: Conductivity in mS/m.
    - `Log10_Conductivity_mSm`: Log base 10 of conductivity in mS/m.
    - `Resistivity_ohm_m`: Resistivity in ohm meters.
    - `Log10_Resistivity_ohm_m`: Log base 10 of resistivity in ohm meters.

- **astrape_inversion_extended_data.xyz**: Contains the same data as `astrape_inversion_extended_data.csv` but in XYZ format.

The data files are saved in the `deliverables` directory within the survey region folder.
