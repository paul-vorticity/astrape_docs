description: 'This case study shows the difference in value that a 2.5D inversion can provide vs a 1D inversion from the same data.'

## Introduction

In geophysical surveys, the accuracy and resolution of the inversion process are critical for interpreting subsurface structures. Traditional 1D inversions, which assume that the subsurface properties vary only with depth, often fall short in capturing the true complexity of geological formations. In contrast, 2.5D inversions account for variations in two dimensions while maintaining a computational efficiency similar to 2D methods. This case study illustrates the significant benefits of using a 2.5D inversion over a 1D inversion, highlighting the enhanced detail and accuracy that can be achieved.

## Case Study Overview

This case study compares the results of 1D and 2.5D inversions applied to the same dataset. By analyzing the outputs, we demonstrate how 2.5D inversion provides a more accurate and detailed representation of subsurface structures.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1D Inversion

In a 1D inversion, the subsurface is assumed to vary only with depth. This simplification can lead to oversights and inaccuracies, particularly in areas with complex geology. The 1D model often results in a smooth, averaged representation of subsurface properties, failing to capture lateral variations and discontinuities that are crucial for accurate geological interpretation.

### 2.5D Inversion

A 2.5D inversion, on the other hand, allows for variations in both depth and one horizontal direction. This approach retains much of the computational efficiency of 2D inversions while significantly improving the resolution and accuracy of the results. By incorporating these additional dimensions, 2.5D inversion can better represent the true complexity of subsurface structures.

#### Enhanced Resolution and Detail

One of the primary benefits of 2.5D inversion is the ability to capture lateral variations in the subsurface. This is particularly important in regions with complex geological features such as faults, folds, and varying lithology. The enhanced resolution provided by 2.5D inversion leads to more accurate geological models, which are essential for resource exploration, environmental studies, and engineering projects.

#### Improved Interpretation and Decision Making

The detailed and accurate subsurface models generated by 2.5D inversion provide a solid foundation for interpretation and decision-making. For example, in mineral exploration, the ability to precisely locate ore bodies and understand their spatial extent can significantly impact the success of exploration efforts. Similarly, in environmental studies, accurately mapping contamination plumes can inform remediation strategies and ensure the protection of groundwater resources.

## Conclusion

The comparison between 1D and 2.5D inversions clearly demonstrates the superior capabilities of the latter. By accounting for variations in two dimensions, 2.5D inversion provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the subsurface, leading to better-informed decisions and more successful outcomes in various geophysical applications. The additional computational effort required for 2.5D inversion is well justified by the substantial improvements in data quality and interpretability.
