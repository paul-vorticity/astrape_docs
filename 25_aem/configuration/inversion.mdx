description: 'How to setup your inversion configuration file'

---

The inversion configuration file specifies the parameters and algorithms used to process the collected data and generate the subsurface model. It includes settings for the experiment, mesh configuration, inversion constants, initial model, and sigma values to guide the inversion process and produce accurate results.
