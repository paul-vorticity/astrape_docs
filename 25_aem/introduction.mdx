### What is a 2.5D AEM Inversion?

2.5D inversion of Airborne Electromagnetic data is a geophysical data processing technique that combines the simplicity of 2D inversion with some aspects of 3D inversion.

### How Does 2.5D Inversion Work?

In 2.5D inversion, the subsurface is assumed to vary smoothly in the direction perpendicular to the survey lines while maintaining full variation along the survey lines. The method involves solving the inversion problem along each line to predict the geophysical response of a given subsurface model and then adjusting the model to minimize the difference between the predicted and observed data. This iterative process continues until the model converges to a solution that best fits the observed data.

### Simulations and Gradient Calculations

All simulations and gradient calculations in this method are performed in 3D. Although the model itself is 2D, it is projected into 3D for these simulations and calculations to ensure accurate and realistic results. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the subsurface variations and enhances the inversion process.
