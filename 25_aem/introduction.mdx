### What is a 2.5D AEM Inversion?

2.5D inversion of Airborne Electromagnetic data is a geophysical data processing technique that combines the simplicity of 2D inversion with some aspects of 3D inversion.

### How Does 2.5D Inversion Work?

In 2.5D inversion, the subsurface is assumed to vary smoothly in the direction perpendicular to the survey lines while maintaining full variation along the survey lines. The method involves solving the inversion problem along each line to predict the geophysical response of a given subsurface model and then adjusting the model to minimize the difference between the predicted and observed data. This iterative process continues until the model converges to a solution that best fits the observed data.
