This script performs the inversion process for the survey data. It supports both 2D and 3D inversions, with the option to check for a warm start to potentially reuse previous inversion preparation, reducing the start up time. The process is managed through Ray's job submission system.

## Usage

To run the inversion, use the following command:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/start.py <survey_dir> <dim> [--warm / -w]
```

### Parameters

- **survey_dir**: The path of the survey directory.
- **dim**: The inversion dimension (`2d` or `3d`).
- **-w**: (Optional) Including this flag will prevent searching for a warm start. A warm start uses existing results from a previous run to avoid redundant computation, speeding up the starting of an inversion process. It is enabled by default.

### Example

Run a 2D inversion with warm start enabled:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/start.py /path/to/survey 2d 
```

Run a 3D inversion without checking for warm start:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/start.py /path/to/survey 3d --w
```
