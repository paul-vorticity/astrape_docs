This script performs the inversion process for the survey data. It supports both 2D and 3D inversions, managing the data and submission through Ray.

## Usage

To run the inversion, use the following command:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/start.py <directory_path> <dim>
```

### Parameters

- **directory_path**: The directory path of the survey directory.
- **dim**: The inversion dimension (`2d` or `3d`).

### Process

- For **2D inversions**, it submits a job for each line in the survey.
- For **3D inversions**, it processes the entire survey in one submission.

Running this will start the inversion process, submitting jobs to the Ray cluster for processing. You can view the job progress in the Ray dashboard.
