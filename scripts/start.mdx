# Run the Inversion

This script performs the inversion process for the survey data. It supports both 2D and 3D inversions, managing the data and submission through Ray.

## Usage

To run the inversion, use the following command:

```bash
python run_inversion.py <directory_path> <dim>
```

### Parameters

- **directory_path**: The directory path where the survey data and inversion results are stored (default: `astrape/resources/benchmark`).
- **dim**: The inversion dimension (`2d` or `3d`).

### Process

- For **2D inversions**, it submits a job for each line in the survey.
- For **3D inversions**, it processes the entire survey in one submission.

## Example

```bash
python run_inversion.py /path/to/survey_data 3d
```

Running this will start the inversion process, submitting jobs to the Ray cluster for processing.
