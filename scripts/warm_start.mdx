# Warm Start Inversion

This script allows users to warm start an inversion process from a previously computed setup. It loads the existing inversion data and resumes the computation from where it left off.

## Usage

To warm start an inversion, use the following command:

```bash
python warm_start_inversion.py <exp_path> <dim>
```

### Parameters

- **exp_path**: The folder where the previous inversion data is stored.
- **dim**: The inversion dimension (`2d` or `3d`).

### Process

- For **2D inversions**, it submits a job for each line in the survey, resuming from the last point.
- For **3D inversions**, it resumes the entire survey inversion from the last computed step.

## Example

```bash
python warm_start_inversion.py /path/to/previous_inversion_data 3d
```

This command starts a new inversion using the prepared objects from the previous inversion data.
