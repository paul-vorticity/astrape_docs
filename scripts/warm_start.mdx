Warm Start
---

This script allows users to warm start an inversion process from a previously computed setup. 
It is useful for running an inversion with the same system, survey, discretization cnfigurations but with different inversion parameters. 

## Usage

To warm start an inversion, use the following command:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/warm_start.py <exp_path> <dim>
```

### Parameters

- **exp_path**: The subfolder in the "inversions" folder where the previous inversion data is stored. This is the timestamped folder created by the inversion process.
- **dim**: The inversion dimension (`2d` or `3d`).

### Process

- For **2D inversions**, it submits a job for each line in the survey, resuming from the last point.
- For **3D inversions**, it resumes the entire survey inversion from the last computed step.

 

<Warning>The schedule strategy, gpu_memory, source_dx, use_topo, inversion_tc_start and  inversion_tc_end parameters within the [inversion configuration](/configuration/inversion) must also not be changed between the previous inversion and the warm start. </Warning>
