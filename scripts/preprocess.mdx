# Preprocess Data

This script preprocesses the survey data before performing an inversion. It ensures that the data is correctly formatted and structured to meet the survey's configuration requirements.

## Usage

To run the preprocessing, use the following command:

```bash
python preprocess.py <survey_dir>
```

- **survey_dir**: This is the directory containing all the survey data. It defaults to `astrape/resources/2016_southern_thomson_tdem`.

## Steps Performed

1. The script checks if the data matches the survey's configuration file.
2. It ensures the data is stored in the correct format and data type for the inversion process.
3. A new column is added to the data file containing the transformed coordinates of all lines.

## Example

```bash
python preprocess.py astrape/resources/2016_southern_thomson_tdem
```

By running this, your data will be ready for inversion.
