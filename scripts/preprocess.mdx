Preprocess Data
---


This script preprocesses the survey data before performing an inversion. It ensures that the data is correctly formatted and structured to meet the survey's configuration requirements.

## Usage

To run the preprocessing, use the following command:

```bash
python3 astrape/run/preprocess.py <survey_dir>
```

- **survey_dir**: This is the survey directory. 

## Steps Performed

1. The script checks if the data matches the system's configuration file.
2. It ensures the data is stored in the correct format and data type for the inversion process, and then prepares a new csv file for the inversion. (It does not overwrite the original data file.)
3. Default configuration files are generated for the inversion process if they are not already present.
4. A line report and discretization report are generated to help you understand the survey data better.
5. A survey_region image file is created to visualize the survey area.


After successfully running this, your data will be ready for inversion.
