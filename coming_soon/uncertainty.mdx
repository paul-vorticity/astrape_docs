title: 'Uncertainty Analysis'

---

One of the benefits of being able to do inversions very fast is that we are able to perform uncertainty analysis on our conductivity models. This is a very important step in the inversion process as it allows us to quantify the uncertainty in our model and understand the reliability of the results.

We are able to perform this analysis by running multiple inversions with different starting models and/or different inversion parameters. By comparing the results of these inversions, we can estimate the uncertainty in the final model and identify areas of high and low confidence.

We are looking to develop this uncertainty analysis feature in the near future. If you have any specific requirements or suggestions for this feature, please let us know by reaching out to our [support team]("mailto:astrape@vorticity.xyz").
