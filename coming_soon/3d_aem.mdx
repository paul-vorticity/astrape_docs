title: '3D AEM Inversions'
---

We are currently working on extending our 2.5D capability to full 3D inversions. 
Please reach out to us if this is something which will improve your mineral exploration efforts!

<Info>
  Since all of the forward simulation and gradient calculations in our 2.5D code are performed in 3D anyway, we are sure that we will be able to do these 3D inversions very soon!
