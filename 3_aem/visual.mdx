The following visualization is produced during the postprocessing stage of a full 3D inversion of Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) data.

We can see the locations of all the source-reciever pairs in the survey as the white dots. In this visualization we are showing the isosurface of conductivity at 1 Log_10(mS/m). The isosurface is a 3D surface that represents the boundary of a region where the conductivity is equal to 1 Log_10(mS/m).

We can also see the topography of the survey area, which is represented by the colored surface. The topography is an important factor in the inversion process, as it affects the electromagnetic fields and the responses of the subsurface.
The model provides a detailed representation of the subsurface resistivity distribution, allowing geophysicists to gain valuable insights into the geological structures and properties of the subsurface.
