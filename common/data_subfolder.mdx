The `data` subfolder is crucial for organizing all the input files necessary for the inversion process. Properly structuring this folder ensures smooth execution and accurate results from the inversion code. Below are the essential components and their descriptions that should be included in the `data` subfolder.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Data File" icon="square-1">
    The main data file in CSV format. This file should contain all the necessary survey data including coordinates, measurements, and any other relevant attributes. The column names of the relevant data should be provided in the config_system.yaml. 
    <ul>
      <li>Columns: `x`, `y`, `z`, `sFz[1]`, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offtime Sampling File" icon="square-2">
    A CSV file containing the receiver sampling times. This is used to define the sampling intervals during the off-time of the waveform.
    <Info> The sampling file name and the column name should be provided in the config_system.yaml file.</Info>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Waveform File" icon="square-3">
    A CSV file that defines the waveform from the source. 
    <Info> The waveform file name, type, and column names should be provided in the config_system.yaml file.</Info>
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Configuration" icon="square-4" href="/configuration/system">
    The system configuration file that outlines the setup of the survey system, including transmitter and receiver settings.
    <ul>
      <li>Required File Name: `config_system.yaml`</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logo Image (optional)" icon="square-8">
    An optional logo image file to be used in reports and visualizations. This file should be placed in the `data` folder and the correct path should be passed in the config_system.yaml if you would like the logo to appear on the reports. 
    <ul>
      <li>Example File Name: `company_logo.png`</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The following configuration files are generated automatically during the preprocessing step and do not need to be provided by the user, HOWEVER they are required for the inversion to run. It is HIGHLY recommended that you modify these files to ensure that the inversion runs according to your preferences. 

<CardGroup cols={1}>  
  <Card title="Discretization Configuration" icon="square-5" href="/configuration/discretization">
    The discretization configuration file that specifies the spatial discretization parameters for the inversion process, such as cell size, padding, and depth range as well as the time discretization.
    <ul>
      <li>Required File Name: `config_discretization.yaml`</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Survey Configuration" icon="square-6" href="/configuration/survey">
    The survey configuration file detailing the specific parameters of the survey, such as the area covered, line spacing, and other survey-specific details.
    <ul>
      <li>Required File Name: `config_survey.yaml`</li>
    </ul>
  <Info> A survey configuration file is generated automatically during the preprocessing step. The default configuration will cover the entire survey area provided in the data file. However, you can modify it to adjust the survey parameters as needed.</Info>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inversion Configuration" icon="square-7" href="/configuration/inversion">
    The inversion configuration file that specifies the parameters and settings for the inversion process, including algorithm settings and initial models.
    <ul>
      <li>Required File Name: `config_inversion.yaml`</li>
    </ul>
    <Info> A default inversion configuration file is generated automatically during the preprocessing step. The default configuration will be based on the provided data and system parameters. It is recommended that you modify it to adjust the inversion parameters as needed.</Info>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Configuration" icon="square-8" href="/configuration/model">
    The model configuration file that defines the initial model for the inversion process, such as the background conductivity and any blocked structures. 
    <ul>
      <li>Required File Name: `config_model.yaml`</li>
    </ul>
    <Info> A default model configuration file is generated automatically during the preprocessing step.</Info>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that all files are named clearly and follow a consistent naming convention to avoid confusion.
- Validate the data in each file to ensure there are no missing or incorrect values that could impact the inversion process.
- Refer to the configuration documentation for detailed descriptions and examples of each configuration file.

By organizing your `data` subfolder according to these guidelines, you will facilitate a streamlined and efficient workflow for your 2.5D inversion projects.
