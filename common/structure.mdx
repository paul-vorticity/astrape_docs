title: Survey Folder Structure
description: 'Organizing and managing your survey data and results'
---

In order to efficiently manage and process your survey data using our 2.5D inversion code, it's essential to organize your input data into the following well-structured folder hierarchy. The structure ensures that all inputs, intermediate results, and final outputs are systematically stored and can be accessed by the astrape executable. 

Below is an overview of the folder structure which the astrape code supports:

#### Folder Structure

```
survey_project/
├── data/
├── inversion/
├── deliverables/
```

<Info>
The inversion and deliverables folders are created automatically by the astrape code during the inversion and postprocessing steps respectively. The only folder you need to create manually is the data folder.

#### Description of Subfolders

- **data/**: This folder contains all the input files necessary for the inversion process. Please see [here](/common/data_subfolder) for more details.  
- **inversion/**: This folder holds all the intermediate data generated during the inversion process. Each inversion run which you create will generate a new timestamped subfolder. 
- **deliverables/**: This folder stores all the final outputs generated during the postprocessing. The subfolders here matches the timestamp name created in the inversion folder.
