<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Ray">
    Set up a Ray head node with the following command: 
    ```
    ray start --head
    ```
    To attach additional nodes to this cluster, run the following command on those servers:
    ```
    ray start --address='IP_ADDRESS:6379'
    ```
    <Warning>Replace 'IP_ADDRESS' with the one displayed from the output of the `ray start --head` command.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Folder Structure">
    Create a folder for the inversion, including a subfolder named 'data' for input files. See the [survey folder structure page](/common/structure) and the [data subfolder page](/common/data_subfolder) for more details.
    <Tip>Ensure all necessary files are correctly placed in the `data` subfolder to avoid issues during the inversion process.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare System Configuration File">
    Prepare the system configuration file, which defines how to read the data and specifies the airborne EM system. Refer to the [system configuration page](/configuration/system) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preprocessing">
    Perform preprocessing, which includes system configuration validation, default configuration file generation, and data validation/preparation, with the command:
    ```
    astrape_25d preprocess /path_to_survey_folder
    ```
    <Warning>Ensure the 'path_to_survey_folder' is correct. Incorrect paths or data can lead to errors.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Modify Configuration Files">
    Review and modify the default survey and inversion configuration files generated during preprocessing. Refer to the [survey configuration page](/configuration/survey) and the [inversion configuration page](/configuration/inversion) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Inversion">
    Run the inversion with the command:
    ```
    astrape_25d run /path_to_survey_folder
    ```
    <Warning>The inversion process may take significant time based on the survey lines, parameters, and hardware. </Warning>
    Monitor progress by checking the `inversion` folder for intermediate data or the `ray` dashboard. See our [Ray explainer](/essentials/ray) for accessing the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Postprocessing">
    After the inversion, perform postprocessing to generate final deliverables with the command:
    ```
    astrape_25d postprocess /path_to_experiment_folder
    ```
    Check the `deliverables` folder for the final results, including reports and visualizations.
    <Check>Review the [PDF report](/25_aem/outputs/report), [data files](/25_aem/outputs/data), and [visualizations](/25_aem/outputs/visualization) in the `deliverables` folder to analyze your inversion results.</Check>
